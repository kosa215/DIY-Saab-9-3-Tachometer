# DIY-Saab-9-3-Tachometer

## Motivation
A few months after buying my first manual transmission vehicle, I was having a lot of fun with it but found myself with a problem I wanted to solve. At the same time, I knew the project would involve learning more about CAN-networking, Raspberry Pi, and bluetooth communication.
