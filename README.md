# DIY Saab 9-3 Tachometer

## Motivation
A few months after buying my first manual transmission [vehicle](/images/saab_exterior.jpg), I was having a lot of fun with it but found myself with a problem I wanted to solve. At the same time, I knew the project would involve learning more about CAN-networking, Raspberry Pi, and bluetooth communication.

Below is the what the information panel looks like on the car. It's pretty basic - tachometer on the left, spedometer in the middle, some other gauges on the right, text display on the bottom, and some lights throughout.

## Future tasks
-Hijack text-display on Saab panel to display the gear.
